# Introduction and Overview 
Neuroscience delves into the biological underpinnings of human cognition and behavior.
At its core are neurons, the nerve cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. These signals rely on neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which sculpt our mental landscape.The brain's structure comprises various regions, each with specific functions. The cerebral cortex handles complex cognition, while the limbic system manages emotions and memory. Glial cells provide support and nourishment to neurons, essential for brain health.Central to neuroscience is neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to rewire itself in response to experiences. This dynamic process underlies learning, memory, and recovery from injury.Genetics and epigenetics shape brain development and function, influencing susceptibility to neurological disorders. Understanding these biological aspects offers insights into the complexities of the human brain, paving the way for innovative therapies and discoveries.
