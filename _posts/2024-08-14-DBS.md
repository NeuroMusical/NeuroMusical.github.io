## Overview
This device is used to treat neurological disorders like Parkinsonâ€™s disease, tremors, dystonia, and psychiatric conditions. It contains implanted electrodes that deliver impulses to specific regions. 

## How It Works:
- Electrodes: Surgically implanted into the brain
- Pulse Generator: pulse generators are implanted under the skin near the chest and abdomen and are similar to 
- Programming: The device is externally programmable, allowing doctors to adjust the electrical impulses according to the patient's needs.

## Applications in Neuroscience
- Parkinson's Disease: DBS is used mostly to manage motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement).
- Research: DBS is also important in neuroscience research, helping scientists understand brain circuits and the effects of modulating neural activity.

## Recent Advancements:
- Adaptive DBS: Newer systems can adjust stimulation in real-time based on the brain's activity, leading to more personalized and effective treatment.
- Minimally Invasive Procedures: Advances in surgical techniques and imaging technologies have made the implantation process safer and less invasive.

## Challenges:
- Side Effects: Potential side effects include speech difficulties, mood changes, and infection risks.
- Ethical Considerations: The use of DBS for psychiatric conditions raises ethical questions about personality changes and consent.
