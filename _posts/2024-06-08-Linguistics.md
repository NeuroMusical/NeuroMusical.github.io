## Introduction and Overview 
The information presented here has been generated using advanced artificial intelligence technologies, with human oversight and refinement of the results. 
## Language Acquisition 
  - examines how children acquire language skills
  - phonology (sounds), syntax (grammar), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (social use of language).
## **Language Processing**:
  - Neurolinguistic studies useS techniques like fMRI, EEG, and MEG (magnetoencephalography) to investigate brain regions involved in language processing, including Broca's area and Wernicke's area.
## **Language Disorders**:
  - Aphasia, caused by brain damage typically from stroke or trauma, affects language abilities such as speaking, understanding, reading, and writing.
  - Dyslexia involves difficulties with reading and spelling despite normal intelligence and sensory abilities
